We define an enum called CellStatus as follows (in Eclipse File ⇒ New ⇒ Enum). Save the file as "CellStatus.java" just like a class. Enum is indeed a special class.

package sudoku;
/**
 * An enumeration of constants to represent the status
 * of each cell.
 */
public enum CellStatus {
   GIVEN,         // clue, no need to guess
   TO_GUESS,      // need to guess - not attempted yet
   CORRECT_GUESS, // need to guess - correct guess
   WRONG_GUESS    // need to guess - wrong guess
      // The puzzle is solved if none of the cells have 
      //  status of TO_GUESS or WRONG_GUESS
}
You can refer to the status as CellStatus.CORRECT_GUESS, CellStatus.WRONG_GUESS, just like any public static final constants (like Math.PI).
