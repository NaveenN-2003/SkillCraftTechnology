A Sudoku (i.e. the puzzle) is a partially completed grid. A grid has 9 rows, 9 columns and 9 boxes (or blocks or regions), each having 9 cells (or squares), for a total of 81 cells. The initially defined values are clues or givens. An ordinary Sudoku (i.e. a proper Sudoku) has only one solution. Rows, columns and boxes can be collectively referred to as groups, of which the grid has 27. The One Rule can be compactly stated as: "Each digit appears once in each group."

Mathematically, Sudoku is a NP-complete problem. There is no known fast polynomial algorithm for solving the puzzle.
